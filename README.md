# Coffin-Case
## Entomb your work forever!
\
A rather grim-looking case, built to last: 
* No re-assembling allowed
* Glued-down lid (OTA updates or nothing)
* Sturdy walls around the 804040 LiPo
* ~~Cable~~Wire-management so tight, you better salvage a bunch from that HDMI cable
* No external indicators, except for the charger's cooling grate
* * Better install that battery-sensing resistor!
* Built for MPU-6050 WeMos D1 Pro Mini V3.0 (Should work with any other D1 Mini Mini)
* Optimized for FDM 3d-printing (ABS/ASA for that satisfying brick feel)
* Engrave anything on the lid using Windows 10+ 3D Builder program, to get a subtle, yet recognizeable pattern on top
